Sterling Crispin is interested in biometric surveillance. His piece "Data Masks" uses facial recognition algorithms like the ones used by Facebook and sends them in the reverse direction. The 3D-printed product is unsettling, some masks are recognizable as derivatives of human form, others less so. Cripsin is interested in "the way the machine and the surveillance state view human identity."

CLOUDS is an interactive documentary created by 40 different computational designers. James George showed the film at Sundance and at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2014. It uses Microsoft Kinect to explore 3D visuals and has a "story engine" of topics, concepts, and threads that ensures continuity of the dialogue. The documentary is interactive - it does not play the same way every time. The story engine works with the tags on the many interview clips to put together a continuous story. This documentary is groundbreaking in the realm of storytelling and in data visualization - it uses forward thinking tech to ask questions about 'what is story' and 'how do people connect'?
